    "Selecting good training samples for machine learning classification of satellite images is critical to achieving accurate results. Experience with machine learning methods has shown that the number and quality of training samples are crucial factors in obtaining accurate results. This chapter presents pre-processing methods to improve the quality of samples and eliminate those that may have been incorrectly labelled or possess low discriminatory power. This chapter explains the basics of machine learning and provides examples of designing and using good training sets. The text explains k-fold validation, SOM clustering and sample imbalance removal, with examples in R. \n",

    "## Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a technique to estimate the inherent prediction error of a model [[4](#ref-hastie2009)]. Since cross-validation uses only the training samples, its results are not accuracy measures unless the samples have been carefully collected to represent the diversity of possible occurrences of classes in the study area [[10](#ref-wadoux2021)]. In practice, when working in large areas, it is hard to obtain random stratified samples which cover the different variations in land classes associated with the ecosystems of the study area. Thus, cross-validation should be taken as a measure of model performance on the training data and not an estimate of overall map accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation uses part of the available samples to fit the classification model and a different part to test it. The k-fold validation method splits the data into $k$ partitions with approximately the same size and proceeds by fitting the model and testing it $k$ times. At each step, we take one distinct partition for the test and the remaining ${k-1}$ for training the model and calculate its prediction error for classifying the test partition. A simple average gives us an estimation of the expected prediction error. The recommended choices of $k$ are $5$ or $10$ [[4](#ref-hastie2009)].\n",
    "\n",
    "In waht follows, we provide an example of 5-fold validation using a data set containing 1,882 labeled samples of land classes in Mato Grosso state of Brazil. The samples have time series extracted from the MODIS MOD13Q1 product from 2000 to 2016, provided every 16 days at 250 m resolution in the Sinusoidal projection. Based on ground surveys and high-resolution imagery, it includes samples of seven classes: `Forest`, `Cerrado`, `Pasture`, `Soy_Fallow`, `Soy_Cotton`, `Soy_Corn`, and `Soy_Millet`. "

    "The results show a good validation, reaching 96% accuracy. However, this accuracy does not guarantee a good classification result. Cross-validation measures how well the model fits the training data. Using these results to measure classification accuracy is only valid if the training data is a good sample of the entire dataset.  Regional differences in soil and climate conditions for large areas will lead the same classes to have different spectral responses. Field analysts may be restricted to places they have access (e.g., along roads) when collecting samples. An additional problem is mixed pixels. Expert interpreters select samples that stand out in fieldwork or reference images. Border pixels are unlikely to be chosen as part of the training data. For all these reasons, cross-validation results are used to measure how good is the fit of the model to the training samples and do not measure classification accuracy. \n",

    "This section presents a clustering technique based on self-organizing maps (SOM) for quality control of training samples. SOM is a dimensionality reduction technique [[6](#ref-kohonen1990)], where high-dimensional data is mapped into a two-dimensional map, keeping the topological relations between data patterns. As shown in [Figure 1](#fig-ts-som2d), the SOM 2D map is composed of units called neurons. Each neuron has a weight vector, with the same dimension as the training samples. At the start, neurons are assigned a small random value and then trained by competitive learning. The algorithm computes the distances of each member of the training set to all neurons and finds the neuron closest to the input, called the best matching unit."

    "The input data for quality assessment is a set of training samples, which are high-dimensional data; for example, a time series with 25 instances of 4 spectral bands has 100 dimensions. When projecting a high-dimensional dataset into a 2D SOM map, the units of the map (called neurons) compete for each sample. Each time series will be mapped to one of the neurons. Since the number of neurons is smaller than the number of classes, each neuron will be associated with many time series. The resulting 2D map will be a set of clusters. Given that SOM preserves the topological structure of neighborhoods in multiple dimensions, clusters that contain training samples with a given label will usually be neighbors in 2D space. The neighbors of each neuron of a SOM map provide information on intraclass and interclass variability, which is used to detect noisy samples. The methodology of using SOM for sample quality assessment is discussed in detail in the reference paper [[9](#ref-santos2021a)].\n",

    "\n",
    "To perform the SOM-based quality assessment, the first step is to run `sits_som_map()`, which uses the `sits` R package to compute a SOM grid, controlled by five parameters. The grid size is given by `grid_xdim` and `grid_ydim`. The starting learning rate is `alpha`, which decreases during the interactions. To measure the separation between samples, use `distance` (either \"dtw\" or \"euclidean\"). The number of iterations is set by `rlen`. When using `sits_som_map()` in machines which have multiprocessing support for the OpenMP protocol, setting the learning mode parameter `mode` to \"patch\" improves processing time. In Windows, please use \"online\". \n",

    "We suggest using the Dynamic Time Warping (\"dtw\") metric as the distance measure. It is a technique used to measure the similarity between two temporal sequences that may vary in speed or timing [[1](#ref-berndt1994)]. The core idea of DTW is to find the optimal alignment between two sequences by allowing non-linear mapping of one sequence onto another. In time series analysis, DTW matches two series slightly out of sync. This property is useful in land use studies for matching time series of agricultural areas [[7](#ref-maus2015)]."

    "Many labels are associated with clusters where there are some samples with a different label. Such confusion between labels arises because sample labeling is subjective and can be biased. In many cases, interpreters use high-resolution data to identify samples. However, the actual images to be classified are captured by satellites with lower resolution. In our case study, a MOD13Q1 image has pixels with 250 m resolution. As such, the correspondence between labeled locations in high-resolution images and mid to low-resolution images is not direct. The bar plot shows some confusion between the labels associated with the natural vegetation typical of the Brazilian Cerrado (`Savanna`, `Savanna_Parkland`, `Rocky_Savanna`). This mixture is due to the large variability of the natural vegetation of the Cerrado biome, which makes it difficult to draw sharp boundaries between classes. Some confusion is also visible between the agricultural classes. The `Fallow_Cotton` class is a particularly difficult one since many of the samples assigned to this class are confused with `Soy_Cotton` and `Millet_Cotton`. \n",

For example, if a neuron has 20 samples, of which 15 are labeled as `Pasture` and 5 as `Forest`, all samples labeled Forest are assigned a prior probability of 25%. This indicates that Forest samples in this neuron may not be of good quality.\n",

Take the case of the above-mentioned neuron whose samples labeled `Pasture` have a prior probability of 75%. What happens if all the neighboring neurons have `Forest` as a majority label? To answer this question, we use Bayesian inference to estimate if these samples are noisy based on the surrounding neurons [[9](#ref-santos2021a)]. \n",

It requires the `prior_threshold` and `posterior_threshold` parameters according to the following rules:\n",

This is an anomalous condition and is tagged as \"analyze\". Users are encouraged to inspect such samples to find out whether they are in fact noisy or not.\n",

The `sits_som_clean_samples()` has an additional parameter (`keep`), which indicates which samples should be kept in the set based on their prior and posterior probabilities. The default for `keep` is `c(\"clean\", \"analyze\")`. As a result of the cleaning, about 900 samples have been considered to be noisy and thus to be possibly removed. We first show the complete distribution of the samples and later remove the noisy ones."

Large and accurate datasets are preferable, regardless of the algorithm used, while noisy training samples can negatively impact classification performance [[3](#ref-frenay2014)]. Thus, it is beneficial to use pre-processing methods to improve the quality of samples and eliminate those that may have been incorrectly labeled or possess low discriminatory power.\n",

    "It is necessary to distinguish between wrongly labeled samples and differences resulting from the natural variability of class signatures. When working in a large geographic region, the variability of vegetation phenology leads to different patterns being assigned to the same label. A related issue is the limitation of crisp boundaries to describe the natural world. Class definitions use idealized descriptions (e.g., \"a savanna woodland has tree cover of 50% to 90% ranging from 8 to 15 m in height\"). Class boundaries are fuzzy and sometimes overlap, making it hard to distinguish between them. To improve sample quality, `sits` provides methods for evaluating the training data.  For large datasets, we recommend using both imbalance-reducing and SOM-based algorithms. The SOM-based method identifies potential mislabeled samples and outliers that require further investigation. The methods for balancing training samples reduce bias in favour of classes of high occurrences. The results demonstrate a positive impact on the overall classification accuracy.\n",
